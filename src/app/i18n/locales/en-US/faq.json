            "question": "What is an AI-native DAM?",
            "answer": "An AI-native digital asset management (DAM) platform like MuseDAM is built from the ground up with artificial intelligence at its core. Unlike traditional DAM systems that rely on manual processes, an AI-native DAM automatically analyzes, tags, and organizes your digital content—from high-resolution images and videos to design files and documents. It provides intelligent search capabilities through natural language queries, automated content discovery, and smart recommendations. Most importantly, AI-native DAM systems like MuseDAM transform creative workflows by eliminating manual tasks, dramatically increasing productivity, and ensuring consistent brand management across all channels."
